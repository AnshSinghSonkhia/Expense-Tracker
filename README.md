In the era of financial management, individuals face the challenge of keeping track of their expenses, budgeting effectively, and gaining insights into their spending habits.

## Objective

The objective of the Expense Tracker is to provide users with a practical tool for managing their finances effectively. By offering insights into spending habits and encouraging budget-conscious decision-making, the app aims to empower individuals to achieve their financial goals and maintain a healthy financial lifestyle.
